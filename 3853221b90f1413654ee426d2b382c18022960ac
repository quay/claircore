rhel: move IgnoreUnpatched config key from updater to matcher

Previously the IgnoreUnpatched config key was a part of the RHEL
updater and would dictate whether or not the updater would ingest
unpatched vulnerabilities. This change moves that key to the RHEL
matcher and dictates whether the matcher should check for a
fixed_in_version when querying potential vulnerabilities. This makes the
config option more usable at the expense of DB size.
