integration: make `PGVERSION` a pattern

The behavior of the setup of an embedded PostgreSQL in integration tests
has changed. The relevant environment variable (`PGVERSION`) is now a
pattern instead of a literal version string. Note that a version string
would be a patten that matches itself, so that format continues to work.

Additionally, the version used is now read from the distributed
manifest, rather than hard-coded versions. Other than occasional network
calls to fetch this manifest, users shouldn't notice any difference.
