all: purge `http.DefaultClient` usage

Some packages with less churn (`photon`, `oracle`, `aws`) were using
older ways of getting an `*http.Client` or using `http.DefaultClient`.

This change breaks some API in exchange for unifying the `*http.Client`
handling. The practical upshot is that it's much easier to control the
network contact surface.
