rhel: deprecate updater in favor of VEX updater

We can extract vulnerability information about containers from the
VEX data. This negates the need to look for it in the cvemap.xml file.
This change modifies the VEX updater to allow for ingesting
vulnerabilities in a way that can be matched my the RHCC matcher.
