libindex: move to O_TMPFILE fetcher

This release uses a new fetcher (the component responsible for pulling
layers locally) that makes use of the O_TMPFILE flag to open(2). This
ensures that layer files will be cleaned up even in the event of an
unclean shutdown, including being sent a KILL signal.
