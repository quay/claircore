datastore: add vuln and enrich stream updates

In an effort to reduce memory consumption during updating the
vulnerability database, add support for iterators. Extend Updater
interface with `UpdateVulnerabilitiesIter` method that performs
the same operation as `UpdateVulnerabilities` but accepts an iterator
function instead of a slice. Also, extend the `EnrichmentUpdater`
interface with `UpdateEnrichmentsIter` in the same way.
