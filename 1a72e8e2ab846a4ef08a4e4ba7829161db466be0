rpm: add function to determine if packages are installed from RPMs

This change allows language detectors to be able to discard packages
that have been determined to have come from an RPM package. This ensures
that only the RPM package is matched to advisories and reduces
false-positives where language packages are patched but their metadata
is not updated (or cannot be updated).
