libindex: add `O_TMPFILE` fallback logic

After discovering that some common deployment methods are incompatible with
using the `O_TMPFILE` `open(2)` flag, a fallback path has been added. The
changes also move the default location of where temporary files are downloaded
to, to better align with the layout recommended by systemd.

Please see [the documentation] for specifics.
