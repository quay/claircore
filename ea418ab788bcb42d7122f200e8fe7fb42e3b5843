all: share single FS implementation

Claircore components that deal with `Layer` objects now share a single
backing File and a single `fs.FS` implementation when using the `FS`
method. There should be no noticeable changes for users, but out-of-tree
implementations may want to move over to using the new FS method.

This change should improve memory usage.
