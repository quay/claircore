URLs are now included in the prose documentation

Previous, changes to URLs needed to be copied into the prose documentation;
this means the documentation was almost always out of sync.
There's now a tool to process comment directives and slipstream the URLs into the documentation in the build step.
Contributors should see the `docs/injecturls.go` file for information on how to use the system in code.
