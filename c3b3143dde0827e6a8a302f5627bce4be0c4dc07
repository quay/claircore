RPM is removed as a dependency

Claircore no longer requires `rpm`. Previously, `rpm` was executed as a
subprocess to examine rpm's BerkeleyDB-based databases. This required
extra disk space, extra dependencies, and had the potential to leak
resources. Now, claircore implements just enough knowledge of the
BerkeleyDB hash database format to be able to extract headers that it
already had the means to interpret. Users of claircore should also be
able run without zombie handling, as claircore no longer spawns
subprocesses.
