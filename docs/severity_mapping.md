# Severity Mapping

ClairCore will normalize a security databases's severity string to a set of defined values.  
Clients may use the `NormalizedSeverity` field on a `claircore.Vulnerability` to react to vulnerability severities without needing to know each security database's severity strings.  
All strings used in the mapping tables are identical to the strings found within the relevant security database.  

## ClairCore Severity Strings
The following are severity strings ClairCore will normalize others to.  
Clients can guarantee one of these strings will be associated with a claircore.Vulnerability.  
```
Unknown
Negligible
Low
Medium
High
Critical
Defcon1
```
