# Scanner Data Model
Libindex utilizes a scanner package with a simple datamodel.  
Data model focuses on image and layer hashes being content addressable allowing us to treat them as unique entities.  
Data model does not focus on storing layer and image information with the assumption that this data will go stale and that your container registry is the true owner of that data.  
Libindex is essentially a microservice for scanning containers and extracting packages and the data model is the bare minimum to support this use case.
