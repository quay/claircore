Handling of "pep440" versions has changed

Previously, versions of type "pep440" were inadvertently handled by two
different packages -- one was used for validation, another for
comparisons. Claircore now uses a single package. There should be no
noticeable change in the behavior of python indexing or matching, so
please file bugs if there are regressions.
