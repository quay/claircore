osv: parse database_specific severity when no CVSS severity is defined

Occasionally there are OSV advisories that don't include any severity
information in the `.severity` object but they do contain a severity in
the `.database_specific` object. This change attempts to parse that
severity if we don't get a severity from the native `.severity` object.
