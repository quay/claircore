rhel: Include cve defs when parsing through rhel oval feeds

There was condition that excluded cve definition types when converting
OVAL definitions to vulns, currently for rhel8 unpatched feeds
the definitions are either oval:com.redhat.cve:def:... or
oval:com.redhat.unaffected:def:.... This change adds a condition
to only continue to ignore these cve definitions if the config explicitly
says to do so. Note: Once these vulns are in the DB they will be
surfaced and updating the config won't delete them, they will be
queried until the next update cycle.
