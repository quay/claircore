vex: allow timeout to pull down VEX archive to be configurable

As part of the RHEL VEX update process claircore will initially pull down an
archive of all CVEs, this archive includes all CVEs not just the ones
that affect Red Hat products. This means the file (while compressed)
will be quite large. The code previously allowed a timeout of 2 minutes
to pull down this file. This value remains the default but users have the
option to configure it to a different value using
updaters.config.rhel-vex.compressed_file_timeout.
