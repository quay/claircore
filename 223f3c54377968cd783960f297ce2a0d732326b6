whiteout: Add the ability to reason about whiteout files in layers

This change give the indexing process a mechanism to discover whiteout
files and use them to inform the final index report. A Resolver step
is added to the end of the indexing process to allow for logic to be
injected after the various indexers' results have been compiled.
Indexers are expected to add a filepath to the packages they discover
to denote that the deletion of the filepath signifies the package is
delete.
