However, binaries running with an effective UID of 0 are unaffected.","links":"https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-18276 http://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/2019/CVE-2019-18276.html https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wGtxJ8opa8 https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1158028","severity":"Low","normalized_severity":"Low","package":{"id":"","name":"bash","version":"","normalized_version":""},"distribution":{"id":"","did":"ubuntu","name":"Ubuntu","version":"16.04.6 LTS (Xenial Xerus)","version_code_name":"xenial","version_id":"16.04","arch":"","cpe":"","pretty_name":"Ubuntu 16.04.6 LTS"},"repository":{"id":"","name":"","key":"","uri":""},"fixed_in_version":""},"288265":{"id":"288265","updater":"","name":"CVE-2019-19126","description":"On the x86-64 architecture, the GNU C Library (aka glibc) before 2.31 fails to ignore the LD_PREFER_MAP_32BIT_EXEC environment variable during program execution after a security transition, allowing local attackers to restrict the possible mapping addresses for loaded libraries and thus bypass ASLR for a setuid program.","links":"https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-19126 http://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/2019/CVE-2019-19126.html https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=25204 https://sourceware.org/ml/libc-alpha/2019-11/msg00649.html","severity":"Medium","normalized_severity":"Medium","package":{"id":"","name":"glibc","version":"","normalized_version":""},"distribution":{"id":"","did":"ubuntu","name":"Ubuntu","version":"16.04.6 LTS (Xenial Xerus)","version_code_name":"xenial","version_id":"16.04","arch":"","cpe":"","pretty_name":"Ubuntu 16.04.6 LTS"},"repository":{"id":"","name":"","key":"","uri":""},"fixed_in_version":""},"295077":{"id":"295077","updater":"","name":"CVE-2019-7309","description":"In the GNU C Library (aka glibc or libc6) through 2.29, the memcmp function for the x32 architecture can incorrectly return zero (indicating that the inputs are equal) because the RDX most significant bit is mishandled.","links":"https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-7309 http://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/2019/CVE-2019-7309.html https://sourceware.org/ml/libc-alpha/2019-02/msg00041.html https://sourceware.org/ml/libc-alpha/2019-02/msg00063.html https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=24155","severity":"Negligible","normalized_severity":"Negligible","package":{"id":"","name":"glibc","version":"","normalized_version":""},"distribution":{"id":"","did":"ubuntu","name":"Ubuntu","version":"16.04.6 LTS (Xenial Xerus)","version_code_name":"xenial","version_id":"16.04","arch":"","cpe":"","pretty_name":"Ubuntu 16.04.6 LTS"},"repository":{"id":"","name":"","key":"","uri":""},"fixed_in_version":""},"295638":{"id":"295638","updater":"","name":"CVE-2019-9169","description":"In the GNU C Library (aka glibc or libc6) through 2.29, proceed_next_node in posix/regexec.c has a heap-based buffer over-read via an attempted case-insensitive regular-expression match.","links":"https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-9169 http://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/2019/CVE-2019-9169.html https://debbugs.gnu.org/cgi/bugreport.cgi?bug=34140 https://debbugs.gnu.org/cgi/bugreport.cgi?bug=34142 https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=24114","severity":"Low","normalized_severity":"Low","package":{"id":"","name":"glibc","version":"","normalized_version":""},"distribution":{"id":"","did":"ubuntu","name":"Ubuntu","version":"16.04.6 LTS (Xenial Xerus)","version_code_name":"xenial","version_id":"16.04","arch":"","cpe":"","pretty_name":"Ubuntu 16.04.6 LTS"},"repository":{"id":"","name":"","key":"","uri":""},"fixed_in_version":""},"295654":{"id":"295654","updater":"","name":"CVE-2019-9192","description":"** DISPUTED ** In the GNU C Library (aka glibc or libc6) through 2.29, check_dst_limits_calc_pos_1 in posix/regexec.c has Uncontrolled Recursion, as demonstrated by '(|)(\\\\1\\\\1)*' in grep, a different issue than CVE-2018-20796.
