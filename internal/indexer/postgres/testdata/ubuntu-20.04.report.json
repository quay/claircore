If an attacker underflows the 'num' parameter to memcpy(), this vulnerability could lead to undefined behavior such as writing to out-of-bounds memory and potentially remote code execution. Furthermore, this memcpy() implementation allows for program execution to continue in scenarios where a segmentation fault or crash should have occurred. The dangers occur in that subsequent execution and iterations of this code will be executed with this corrupted data.","issued":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","links":"https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-6096 http://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/2020/CVE-2020-6096.html https://talosintelligence.com/vulnerability_reports/TALOS-2020-1019 https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=25620","severity":"","normalized_severity":"Low","package":{"id":"","name":"libc6","version":"","kind":"binary","normalized_version":"","cpe":""},"distribution":{"id":"","did":"ubuntu","name":"Ubuntu","version":"20.04 LTS (Focal Fossa)","version_code_name":"focal","version_id":"20.04","arch":"","cpe":"","pretty_name":"Ubuntu 20.04 LTS"},"repository":{"cpe":""},"fixed_in_version":""},"3677207":{"id":"3677207","updater":"ubuntu-focal-updater","name":"CVE-2021-20193 on Ubuntu 20.04 (focal) - low.","description":"[Memory leak in read_header() in list.c]","issued":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","links":"https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-20193 http://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/2021/CVE-2021-20193.html https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?59897 https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/tar.git/commit/?id=d9d4435692150fa8ff68e1b1a473d187cc3fd777 http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=980525 https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/tar/+bug/1912091","severity":"","normalized_severity":"Low","package":{"id":"","name":"tar","version":"","kind":"binary","normalized_version":"","cpe":""},"distribution":{"id":"","did":"ubuntu","name":"Ubuntu","version":"20.04 LTS (Focal Fossa)","version_code_name":"focal","version_id":"20.04","arch":"","cpe":"","pretty_name":"Ubuntu 20.04 LTS"},"repository":{"cpe":""},"fixed_in_version":""},"3685282":{"id":"3685282","updater":"ubuntu-focal-updater","name":"CVE-2021-24031 on Ubuntu 20.04 (focal) - medium.","description":"zstd adds read permissions to files while being compressed or uncompressed","issued":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","links":"https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-24031 http://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/2021/CVE-2021-24031.html http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=981404 https://github.com/facebook/zstd/issues/1630","severity":"","normalized_severity":"Medium","package":{"id":"","name":"libzstd1","version":"","kind":"binary","normalized_version":"","cpe":""},"distribution":{"id":"","did":"ubuntu","name":"Ubuntu","version":"20.04 LTS (Focal Fossa)","version_code_name":"focal","version_id":"20.04","arch":"","cpe":"","pretty_name":"Ubuntu 20.04 LTS"},"repository":{"cpe":""},"fixed_in_version":""},"3685286":{"id":"3685286","updater":"ubuntu-focal-updater","name":"CVE-2021-24032 on Ubuntu 20.04 (focal) - medium.","description":"Race condition allows attacker to access world-readable destination file","issued":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","links":"https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-24032 http://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/2021/CVE-2021-24032.html http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=982519 https://github.com/facebook/zstd/issues/2491","severity":"","normalized_severity":"Medium","package":{"id":"","name":"libzstd1","version":"","kind":"binary","normalized_version":"","cpe":""},"distribution":{"id":"","did":"ubuntu","name":"Ubuntu","version":"20.04 LTS (Focal Fossa)","version_code_name":"focal","version_id":"20.04","arch":"","cpe":"","pretty_name":"Ubuntu 20.04 LTS"},"repository":{"cpe":""},"fixed_in_version":""},"3687248":{"id":"3687248","updater":"ubuntu-focal-updater","name":"CVE-2021-27645 on Ubuntu 20.04 (focal) - medium.","description":"The nameserver caching daemon (nscd) in the GNU C Library (aka glibc or libc6) 2.29 through 2.33, when processing a request for netgroup lookup, may crash due to a double-free, potentially resulting in degraded service or Denial of Service on the local system.
