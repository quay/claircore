If an attacker underflows the 'num' parameter to memcpy(), this vulnerability could lead to undefined behavior such as writing to out-of-bounds memory and potentially remote code execution. Furthermore, this memcpy() implementation allows for program execution to continue in scenarios where a segmentation fault or crash should have occurred. The dangers occur in that subsequent execution and iterations of this code will be executed with this corrupted data.","issued":"2020-06-04T00:00:00Z","links":"https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-6096","severity":"","normalized_severity":"Unknown","package":{"id":"","name":"glibc","version":"","normalized_version":"","cpe":""},"distribution":{"id":"","did":"debian","name":"Debian GNU/Linux","version":"9 (stretch)","version_code_name":"stretch","version_id":"9","arch":"","cpe":"","pretty_name":"Debian GNU/Linux 9 (stretch)"},"repository":{"cpe":""},"fixed_in_version":"0"}},"package_vulnerabilities":{"396":["36928","38427","40451","58855"],"398":["41917","56731"],"402":["59140","64257","64260"],"404":["37102","37835","37837","40464","42082","49716","53122","66251","66340","66627"],"406":["45878","52561","54206","58379","58662","59698","61328","63769","64884","65110","65112","66740","66754"],"412":["65195"],"416":["36928","38427","40451","58855"],"422":["65195"],"428":["62943","62720"],"430":["59140","64257","64260"],"432":["64324","40311"],"434":["38487","50668"],"444":["37472","39732","40309","40980","40981","41098","41225","41643","49241","49935","50178","50244","52976","54044","56754","59188","59635","61147","61185","61982","61986","61988","61992","64538","65613","65667","65958","65961","66227","66781","66783","67011"],"450":["37148","37310"],"452":["58418","58492","58493","58939","59070","59072","61675","65634","65637","65639","65640","65710","65711"],"454":["37887","37922","51457","56948","61763","63517"],"460":["39788"],"462":["57869"],"464":["38487","50668"],"466":["45878","52561","54206","58379","58662","59698","61328","63769","64884","65110","65112","66740","66754"],"468":["37472","39732","40309","40980","40981","41098","41225","41643","49241","49935","50178","50244","52976","54044","56754","59188","59635","61147","61185","61982","61986","61988","61992","64538","65613","65667","65958","65961","66227","66781","66783","67011"],"470":["38487","50668"],"472":["52795","53904","55519","55520"],"474":["54194","50669","49104","49103","44259","44257","44255","40207"],"476":["64938"],"478":["65195"],"480":["66179","59507","37676"],"482":["62718"],"484":["38487","50668"],"490":["61193","40452"],"494":["36797","37979","38175","38895","45793","53027","58560","61365","64733"],"498":["59140","64257","64260"],"500":["37472","39732","40309","40980","40981","41098","41225","41643","49241","49935","50178","50244","52976","54044","56754","59188","59635","61147","61185","61982","61986","61988","61992","64538","65613","65667","65958","65961","66227","66781","66783","67011"],"516":["56731","41917"],"520":["36928","38427","40451","58855"],"522":["57869"],"526":["65195"],"530":["36928","38427","40451","58855"],"534":["38487","50668"],"536":["36797","37979","38175","38895","45793","53027","58560","61365","64733"],"542":["59140","64257","64260"],"548":["51431"],"552":["50668","38487"],"558":["38487","50668"]}}
