Directory paths containing an initial tilde followed by a valid username were affected by this issue. A local attacker could exploit this flaw by creating a specially crafted path that, when processed by the glob function, would potentially lead to arbitrary code execution. This was fixed in version 2.32.","issued":"2020-04-30T17:15:00Z","links":"https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-1752 http://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/2020/CVE-2020-1752.html https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=25414","severity":"Low","normalized_severity":"Low","package":{"id":"","name":"glibc","version":"","normalized_version":"","cpe":""},"distribution":{"id":"","did":"ubuntu","name":"Ubuntu","version":"19.10 (Eoan Ermine)","version_code_name":"eoan","version_id":"19.10","arch":"","cpe":"","pretty_name":"Ubuntu 19.10"},"repository":{"cpe":""},"fixed_in_version":""},"118955":{"id":"118955","updater":"","name":"CVE-2020-3810","description":"Missing input validation in the ar/tar implementations of APT before version 2.1.2 could result in denial of service when processing specially crafted deb files.","issued":"2020-05-15T14:15:00Z","links":"https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-3810 http://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/2020/CVE-2020-3810.html https://github.com/Debian/apt/issues/111 https://github.com/julian-klode/apt/commit/de4efadc3c92e26d37272fd310be148ec61dcf36 https://salsa.debian.org/jak/apt/-/commit/dceb1e49e4b8e4dadaf056be34088b415939cda6 https://usn.ubuntu.com/usn/usn-4359-1 https://usn.ubuntu.com/usn/usn-4359-2 https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/apt/+bug/1878177","severity":"Medium","normalized_severity":"Medium","package":{"id":"","name":"apt","version":"","normalized_version":"","cpe":""},"distribution":{"id":"","did":"ubuntu","name":"Ubuntu","version":"19.10 (Eoan Ermine)","version_code_name":"eoan","version_id":"19.10","arch":"","cpe":"","pretty_name":"Ubuntu 19.10"},"repository":{"cpe":""},"fixed_in_version":"1.9.4ubuntu0.1"},"119206":{"id":"119206","updater":"","name":"CVE-2020-6096","description":"An exploitable signed comparison vulnerability exists in the ARMv7 memcpy() implementation of GNU glibc 2.30.9000. Calling memcpy() (on ARMv7 targets that utilize the GNU glibc implementation) with a negative value for the 'num' parameter results in a signed comparison vulnerability. If an attacker underflows the 'num' parameter to memcpy(), this vulnerability could lead to undefined behavior such as writing to out-of-bounds memory and potentially remote code execution. Furthermore, this memcpy() implementation allows for program execution to continue in scenarios where a segmentation fault or crash should have occurred. The dangers occur in that subsequent execution and iterations of this code will be executed with this corrupted data.","issued":"2020-04-01T22:15:00Z","links":"https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-6096 http://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/2020/CVE-2020-6096.html https://talosintelligence.com/vulnerability_reports/TALOS-2020-1019 https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=25620","severity":"Low","normalized_severity":"Low","package":{"id":"","name":"glibc","version":"","normalized_version":"","cpe":""},"distribution":{"id":"","did":"ubuntu","name":"Ubuntu","version":"19.10 (Eoan Ermine)","version_code_name":"eoan","version_id":"19.10","arch":"","cpe":"","pretty_name":"Ubuntu 19.10"},"repository":{"cpe":""},"fixed_in_version":""},"99053":{"id":"99053","updater":"","name":"CVE-2013-4235","description":"shadow: TOCTOU (time-of-check time-of-use) race condition when copying and removing directory trees","issued":"2019-12-03T15:15:00Z","links":"https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-4235 http://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/2013/CVE-2013-4235.html https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=778950 https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=884658","severity":"Low","normalized_severity":"Low","package":{"id":"","name":"shadow","version":"","normalized_version":"","cpe":""},"distribution":{"id":"","did":"ubuntu","name":"Ubuntu","version":"19.10 (Eoan Ermine)","version_code_name":"eoan","version_id":"19.10","arch":"","cpe":"","pretty_name":"Ubuntu 19.10"},"repository":{"cpe":""},"fixed_in_version":""}},"package_vulnerabilities":{"1290":["118955"],"1296":["111523"],"1302":["100136"],"1312":["104353"],"1322":["110301","110479"],"1334":["118955"],"1346":["100016","112825","118749","118750","119206"],"1348":["100016","112825","118749","118750","119206"],"1366":["110293"],"1378":["111439"],"1384":["111451","111454"],"1386":["111451","111454"],"1400":["115169"],"1422":["107276"],"1424":["105062"],"1426":["111451","111454"],"1428":["107276"],"1436":["99053","108166"],"1446":["111451","111454"],"1448":["111451","111454"],"1450":["99053","108166"],"1452":["117417","117662","118394"],"334":["101300","103982","103984"],"386":["117331"]}}
